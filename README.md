 # **Machine Learning Engineer**

Machine learning is the process of using large data sets to train an algorithm to detect patterns and make predictions. A machine learning engineer uses this process to create artificial intelligence systems that can solve real world problems. In other words, they create programs that can find patterns in current data to generate non-existent future data. This long process usually goes as follows:
1. Identify problem or task
2. Find sufficient, relevant data sets
3. Create algorithms to analyze those data sets through coding
4. Refine the results that are generated by those algorithms
5. Apply those results to a different scenario

The products of a machine learning engineer can be seen in software and programs used daily. For example, facial recognition systems, ad relevancy calculations, financial predictions, browser search suggestions, and even self-driving cars all use machine learning. It is up to machine learning engineers to work in teams and use their programming and problem-solving skills to create and improve the models that allow these systems to function.

## Required Education
A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related program is almost always required. Here are some undergrad programs available at Ontario universities that would serve as a good background for a machine learning engineer job:

### *Computer Science:*
- University of Waterloo 
- University of Toronto
- Queen's University
- McMaster University

### *Software Engineering:*
- University of Waterloo 
- University of Toronto
- Queen's University
- Carleton University

### *Data Science:*
- University of Toronto
- University of Ottawa
- University of Waterloo
- Western University

## Education Example Overview
### [Computer Science at University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science)

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6e/University_of_Waterloo_seal.svg/1200px-University_of_Waterloo_seal.svg.png" width="100" height="100">

Waterloo is a top choice for anyone in the engineering and comptuer science fields. The exceptional co-op system offered alongside many of their programs allows students to graduate with up to two years of paid work experience.

### Entrance Requirements: 

- Advanced Functions 
- Calculus and Vectors
- Grade 12U English
- 3 other U/M courses (at least 1 more U)

Individual selection from low-mid 90s (95+ is expected in recent years)

Grade 11 U Computer Science is recommended. 
Participation in math and coding contests such as CCC and Euclid is strongly recommended.

### First Year Courses:
The first year courses mostly involve advanced computer science and mathematics.

Semester 1:
- Designing Functional Programs
- Algebra for Honours Mathematics
- Calculus for Honours Mathematics
- Communications Skills Course
- 1 Elective

Semester 2:
- Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction
- Tools and Techniques for Software Development
- Linear Algebra 1 for Honours Mathematics
- Calculus 2 for Honours Mathematics
- 2 Electives

From the second year onwards, half the semesters are dedicated to co-op, and core courses consist of only computer science, leaving the rest as electives. Electives allow for specializations in specific fields, such as artificial intelligence.

[Additional Graduation Requirements](http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Bachelor-of-Computer-Science-1)

### Program Length: 

5 years for bachelor's degree (includes 2 years of paid work experience)   
2 additional years for master’s degree

## Required Skills
There are a variety of roles a machine learning engineer may fill, but here are some skills that are consistently required of them:

### Tehcnical Skills: 
- Advanced programming experience (In Java, Python, Go, or C++ usually)
- Excellent mathematical ability (especially in statistics and data management)
- High degree of computer literacy

### Non-Technical Skills:
- Innovative
- Organized
- Observant and analytical
- A great problem solver
- A good collaborator and communicator

## Additional Experience
Aside from having a degree, most employers will look for someone with experience around machine learning models or related projects/companies. Here are a few ways to gather practical experience outside the classroom:

### Co-op:
A university co-op program allows students to learn through hands-on experience while getting paid for it. This is a great way to explore one's options and gather valuable skills, and almost ensures students a job soon after graduation. Some standard examples of co-op jobs related to machine learning include web development, research assistance, and technical systems analysis. These jobs all instill skills required for software related employment and working in professional teams.

### Personal Projects:
Software projects have the advantage of requiring very few tools and resources to create. While a machine learning project would be difficult to tackle, the limitless assets available online make it possible. One incredible but fun example I found is an artifical intelligence streamer on Twitch named “[Neuro-sama](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987)”, created by someone named Jack Vedal over the course of four years. This “streamer” relies entirely on machine learning to react and respond to live messages/donations, and even sing and play video games. By linking these systems to speech programs and an anime-style avatar, Vedal created an entirely automated entertainer. He still supervises the streams to make sure his creation never says anything scandalous or TOS-breaking, but the bot is improving on its own day-by-day. Having a project like this on your record would guarantee the interest of any employer.
