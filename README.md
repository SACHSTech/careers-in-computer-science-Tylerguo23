 # **Machine Learning Engineer**

Machine learning is the process of using large data sets to train an algorithm to detect patterns and make predictions. A machine learning engineer uses this process to create artificial intelligence systems that can solve real world problems. In other words, they create programs that can find patterns in current data to generate non-existent future data. This is a long process that goes as follows:
1. Identify problem or task
2. Find sufficient, relevant data sets
3. Create algorithms to analyze those data sets through coding
4. Refine the results that are generated by those algorithms
5. Apply those results to a different scenario 


The products of a machine learning engineer can be seen in software and programs used daily. For example, programs for facial recognition, ad relevancy, financial predictions, and even self-driving cars all use machine learning.
